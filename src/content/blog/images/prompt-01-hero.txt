IMAGE PROMPT: Claude Code Parallel Sessions Hero Image

Style: Clean, technical illustration with a dark slate/navy background. Modern SaaS aesthetic with subtle gradients. Minimalist but detailed. Color palette: deep blues, amber/gold accents, green for healthy status.

Composition:
- Three terminal windows arranged in a slight fan/cascade, each representing a Claude Code session
- Each terminal has the classic red/yellow/green window dots in the header
- Terminal 1 labeled "main" - shows green status indicators
- Terminal 2 labeled "earl-fib-123-feature" - shows green status indicators
- Terminal 3 labeled "experiment-refactor" - shows amber status (in progress)

Below each terminal, show a simplified "isolation bubble":
- Each bubble contains small icons for: database cylinder, server rack, network nodes
- Bubbles are clearly separated with subtle glow effects
- Dotted lines show each terminal connects ONLY to its own bubble

Visual metaphor: Parallel universes or separate sandboxes, each self-contained

Text overlay (optional): "Three Claudes. Three environments. Zero conflicts."

Aspect ratio: 16:9 (blog header)
Resolution: High quality for retina displays

Mood: Professional, technical, slightly futuristic but grounded. Not cartoonish. The kind of diagram you'd see in quality engineering documentation.
