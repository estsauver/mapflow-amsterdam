IMAGE PROMPT: Subdomain Routing Flow Diagram

Style: Clean network/routing diagram. Dark slate background. Flowing lines showing request routing. Color palette: white/light gray for URLs, amber for Traefik router, cyan/teal for destination namespaces.

Layout: Left to right flow

LEFT SIDE - Browser/Request Origins:
- Two browser window icons stacked vertically
- Browser 1 shows URL bar: "main.localhost"
- Browser 2 shows URL bar: "earl-fib-123-feature.localhost"

CENTER - Traefik Ingress Router:
- Hexagonal or rounded rectangle shape
- Labeled "Traefik" with small logo suggestion
- Amber/gold color with subtle glow
- Shows it's the central routing point
- Small text: "*.localhost → namespace"

RIGHT SIDE - Kubernetes Namespaces:
- Two rounded rectangles (namespace boxes)
- Box 1: "worktree-main" containing frontend + backend icons
- Box 2: "worktree-earl-fib-123-feature" containing frontend + backend icons
- Cyan/teal color scheme

FLOW LINES:
- Animated-looking flow lines (dashed or with arrow markers)
- Line from Browser 1 → Traefik → worktree-main (one color)
- Line from Browser 2 → Traefik → worktree-earl-fib-123-feature (different shade)
- Lines should cross through Traefik, showing it as the routing decision point

Additional detail inside namespace boxes:
- Show path routing: "/" → frontend, "/api" → backend
- Small icons for the services

Mood: Technical but accessible. Like a diagram from good infrastructure documentation.

Aspect ratio: 16:9 (wider than tall to show the flow)
