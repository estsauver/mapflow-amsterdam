IMAGE PROMPT: Kubernetes Namespace Architecture Diagram

Style: Clean technical architecture diagram. Dark background (slate-900). Crisp lines and boxes. Color coding: amber/gold for shared infra, cyan/teal for isolated worktrees.

Layout: Top-down hierarchy

TOP LAYER - Single box labeled "infra/" in amber/gold:
- Contains icons/small boxes for:
  - PostgreSQL (database cylinder icon)
  - Temporal Server (workflow/clock icon)
  - Grafana + Prometheus + Jaeger + Loki (monitoring dashboard icon)
  - OpenTelemetry Collector (funnel/collector icon)
- Label: "(shared)"
- Subtle glow effect to show it's the central hub

BOTTOM LAYER - Two boxes side by side in cyan/teal:
- Box 1: "worktree-main/"
  - Contains: frontend, backend, temporal-worker icons
  - Label: "(isolated)"

- Box 2: "worktree-earl-fib-123-feature/"
  - Contains: frontend, backend, temporal-worker icons
  - Label: "(isolated)"

CONNECTIONS:
- Thin dotted lines from each worktree box UP to the infra box
- Lines should indicate "connects to shared services"
- Arrow pointing from worktrees to infra (telemetry/data flow)
- Arrow pointing from infra to worktrees (database/service access)

Visual hierarchy:
- Infra box is slightly larger and more prominent
- Worktree boxes are equal size, clearly separated
- Space between worktree boxes emphasizes isolation

Legend (small, bottom corner):
- Amber = Shared (runs once)
- Cyan = Isolated (cloned per branch)

Aspect ratio: 4:3 or 16:9
No text other than labels. Icons should be simple geometric shapes.
