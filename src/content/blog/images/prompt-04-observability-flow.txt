IMAGE PROMPT: OpenTelemetry Observability Flow Diagram

Style: Data flow / pipeline diagram. Dark background. Glowing data streams. Color palette: multiple distinct colors for different worktree data streams converging into unified observability.

Layout: Many-to-one flow pattern (fan-in)

LEFT SIDE - Multiple Worktree Sources:
- Three vertical stacks representing worktree namespaces
- Stack 1: "worktree-main" - blue/cyan glow
- Stack 2: "worktree-feature-a" - purple/magenta glow
- Stack 3: "worktree-feature-b" - green glow
- Each stack shows small icons: logs (document), metrics (chart), traces (connected dots)

CENTER - OpenTelemetry Collector:
- Large funnel or collector icon
- Labeled "OTel Collector"
- Shows all three colored streams flowing INTO it
- Amber/gold accent color
- Located in "infra" namespace (label it)

RIGHT SIDE - Observability Backends (fan-out from collector):
- Three destination boxes arranged vertically:
  1. Grafana (dashboard icon) - for logs via Loki, metrics via Prometheus
  2. Jaeger (trace icon) - for distributed traces
  3. Prometheus (graph icon) - for metrics
- All in the infra namespace

DATA FLOW VISUALIZATION:
- Colored streams (matching source colors) flow from left to center
- In the collector, streams merge/process
- Output streams fan out to the three backends
- Show that data retains its namespace label (small tags on streams)

Key visual concept: "Many isolated sources → One unified view"

Small callout box: "Filter by namespace in Grafana to see just your worktree"

Aspect ratio: 16:9
Style note: Should feel like a modern data pipeline diagram, not a boring enterprise architecture diagram
